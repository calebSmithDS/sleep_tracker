# sleep_tracker
This app can currently take sleep data as input from user in response to sleep related questions. As of now the data can be used to track sleep patterns overtime, with the intention to add the ablility to analysis sleep patterns overtime. This script can be used in combination with the Termux terminal for Android devices, to enable tracking across devices.

# Features 
- Input sleep data 
- Store sleep data 
- Android terminal compatibility

# Tech Stack 
- Python 3.13
- JSON for file storage 
- Termirux

# Notes 
At the moment the system only allows for user reporting of subjective sleep measures. However, the plan is to add sensors which track data such as heart rate, motion, etc. This would be acheived through a rasperryPI.
This app will be expanded to allow analysis functionality through technologies such as pandas.
